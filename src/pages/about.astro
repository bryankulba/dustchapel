    <h1>About Dust Chapel</h1>
    <p>Dust Chapel is a quiet journal about sound, light, and the patient craft of preserving spaces that prefer to whisper.</p>
    <p>Expect field notes, short essays, and images that pair with the writing. Everything is built with Astro and plain Markdown for longevity.</p>
