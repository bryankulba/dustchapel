I placed two portable recorders near the east windows. The aim was to capture the sound of dust shifting—a soft hiss that you only notice when you stop breathing for a second.

Equipment list:

- Two cardioid condensers aimed at the rafters
- A figure-eight mic hung above the aisle for side ambience
- A small preamp powered by an aging battery pack

Playback confirmed that the space adds a gentle 200 Hz bump, which I’ll need to tame when the final mixes are assembled.

Next steps: swap in the ribbon mic and test how the ribbon reacts to the dry winter air.
