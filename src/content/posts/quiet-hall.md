The chapel hall smells of cedar and dust. Every step pulls a different echo from the floorboards, like testing the memory of the room.

![Window light](../images/window.svg "gallery=hall Window panes sketching long rectangles across the benches.")

![Dust layering the benches](../images/dust.svg "gallery=hall Dust curling through sunbeams at the back of the room.")

![Hall sketch](../images/hall.svg "A quick graphite sketch of the hall from the west entrance.")

Sitting near the center, I tried to map the acoustics with a tuning fork. The resonance lingers longer than expected—nearly seven seconds.
